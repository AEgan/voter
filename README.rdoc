This is a simple app that I am developing because
  I'm bored
  I want this app to exist
  I want practice using rails

Also I want to use github. Feel free to help with this app it's all for fun

Basically people who use the app will be shown two options. They can choose 
which one they prefer and vote for it. There will be leaderboards.
